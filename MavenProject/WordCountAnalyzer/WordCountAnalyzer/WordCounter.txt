Training Report: WordCountAnalyzer Project

Summary:

Throughout the training, several key concepts related to software development using Java and Maven were covered. The WordCountAnalyzer project was designed to provide a hands-on experience in file reading, string manipulation, use of external libraries (Apache Commons), project building with Maven, and dependency management.

Highlights:

Project Structure:

The Maven standard convention for project structure was followed, with src/main/java for the main source code and src/main/resources for associated resources.
Dependency Management:

Apache Commons IO and Lang3 libraries were used for file and string manipulation tasks. These dependencies were managed through Maven's pom.xml file.
File Reading and Manipulation:

Reading a text file and manipulating its content to calculate the number of unique words was implemented.
Maven Build Lifecycle:

The Maven build lifecycle was explored, with commands such as mvn compile, mvn clean, and mvn install used for compiling, cleaning, and packaging the project.
Creating an Executable JAR:

Maven was configured to build an executable JAR with all the necessary dependencies for standalone project execution.
Problem Solving:

Common challenges were addressed, such as file path management, resolution of compilation and execution errors, and Maven configuration to include dependencies and resources in the final JAR.
Use of Maven Plugins:

The maven-assembly-plugin was used to create an executable JAR with all dependencies included.
Coding Practices:

Good coding practices, such as code modularization, exception handling, and efficient use of external libraries, were promoted.
Conclusions:

This exercise provided a practical and applied insight into the fundamental concepts required for software development in a Java environment using Maven. Essential skills were acquired, from file manipulation to project setup and dependency management. This knowledge lays the groundwork for tackling more complex challenges in future projects.
