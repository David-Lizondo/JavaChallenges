During this programming exercise, I have learned and applied several fundamental concepts and practices in object-oriented programming in Java. Some of the highlights include:

Inheritance and Polymorphism: I have created a hierarchy of related classes, using inheritance to share common attributes and methods in a base class called Vehicle. This has allowed the use of polymorphism when creating objects of the derived classes (Busses, Cars, Moto) and treating them uniformly.

Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods: I have defined an abstract class Vehicle that includes abstract methods, forcing derived classes to provide their own implementations. This promotes consistency in the functionality of derived classes.

"Protected" Modifier: I have used the "protected" modifier to allow access to certain attributes and methods in the derived classes, maintaining encapsulation and providing flexibility in inheritance.

Method Overriding: I have overridden the reportStatus, startEngine, accelerate, brake, toString, hashCode, and equals methods in the derived classes, customizing their behavior based on the type of vehicle.

Classes and Objects: I have created multiple objects of different classes, such as Busses, Cars, Moto, Engine, Wheel, and Driver, and used their methods and attributes to represent information about vehicles and drivers.

Compliance with Specific Requirements: I have followed the specific requirements of the exercise, such as creating at least one abstract method, overriding methods from the Object class (such as toString, hashCode, and equals) in at least 3 classes in the hierarchy, and using the "protected" modifier at least 5 times.

In summary, this exercise has provided me with valuable experience in class design, inheritance, polymorphism, and object-oriented programming practices in Java, which will be beneficial in my future work in software development.
