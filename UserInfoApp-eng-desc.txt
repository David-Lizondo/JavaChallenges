This is a simple Java exercise that displays basic user information. The program uses variables to store data about the user, such as their name, age, and weight, and then prints this information to the console.

Description The program consists of two main parts:

Primitive Types: In the first part of the program, variables are used to store information about the user. Three variables are defined:

int age: Stores the user's age.

String name: Stores the user's name.

double weight: Stores the user's weight.

These values are then printed to the console.

Conditionals: The second part of the program checks whether an argument (a username) is provided when running the program from the command line. If a username is provided as an argument, the program displays a personalized greeting message. If no username is provided, an error message is shown, indicating that a username must be provided as an argument.
