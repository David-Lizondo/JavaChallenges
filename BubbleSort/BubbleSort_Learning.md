At the outset, I had to select from the various options presented, different types of Sorts.


Insertion Sort:

Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
It takes each element from the unsorted part and places it in its correct position in the sorted part.

Selection Sort:

Selection sort divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist.
It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.

Bubble Sort:

Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Merge Sort:

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a single sorted array.

Quick Sort:

Quick sort also uses the divide-and-conquer strategy.
It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
It then recursively sorts these sub-arrays.

The code I have created is an implementation in Java of a sorting algorithm called "Bubble Sort." This algorithm is used to arrange a set of data in ascending or descending order. The name "Bubble Sort" comes from the way larger elements "bubble up" to the top of the data set during the sorting process.

In this code, I begin by declaring an array of integers with unordered values and print it in its original state. Then, I use the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array, and finally, I print the sorted array.

I have used do-while loops instead of for loops to implement the algorithm, which has allowed me to experiment with different control structures in Java.

Lessons Learned:

Throughout the creation of this code, I have learned several valuable lessons:

1-Sorting Algorithms: I have gained a deeper understanding of how sorting algorithms work and have gained experience in implementing one of the simplest yet fundamental algorithms.

2-Control Structures: I have explored the use of do-while loops instead of for loops, providing me with a broader perspective on control structures in Java.

3-Testing and Debugging: I have practiced code writing, testing, and debugging to ensure the algorithm functions correctly. This has enhanced my problem-solving skills.

4-Documentation and Comments: I have learned the importance of documenting code with clear and descriptive comments to aid others in understanding and maintaining the code in the future.

Overall, this experience has allowed me to strengthen my Java programming skills and gain a better grasp of sorting algorithm concepts, which are essential for the job I am pursuing. I am eager to continue learning and enhancing my skills in the field of programming and computer science.
